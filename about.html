        <h3>Why should we know</h3>
        <p>Understanding tigers is crucial for several compelling reasons that affect both our planet's biodiversity and human societies. Here's why knowing about tigers matters: <br>

            <b>Ecological Importance</b><br>
            Tigers serve as vital indicators of ecosystem health 
            They play a crucial role in maintaining balanced ecosystems as apex predators
            Their presence helps regulate prey populations, which maintains vegetation balance <br>
            <b>Conservation Urgency</b><br>
            Only about 5,500 tigers remain in the wild globally 
            Their range has decreased dramatically - they now occupy just 7% of their historical territory 
            This dramatic decline makes understanding and protecting them especially critical <br>
            <b>Scientific Value</b><br>
            Each tiger's striping pattern is unique, like fingerprints, enabling individual identification 
            Scientists continue to discover new aspects of tiger behavior and biology 
            Studying tigers helps us understand predator-prey relationships and ecosystem dynamics <br>
            <b>Practical Applications</b><br>
            Human-Tiger Conflict Prevention
            Understanding tiger behavior helps prevent encounters with humans 
            Knowledge informs strategies for protecting both people and tigers
            Resource Management
            Tiger conservation efforts protect large swaths of forest habitat 
            This benefits countless other species sharing their ecosystem <br>
            <b>Broader Benefits</b><br>
            Protecting tiger habitats preserves massive areas of natural forest. Conservation efforts benefit local communities through sustainable resource management. Understanding tigers helps address broader environmental challenges <br>
            <h2>Current Threats Requiring Action</h2>
            Several immediate threats make tiger knowledge particularly urgent:<br>
            <ol>
            <li>Habitat loss and fragmentation</li><br>
            <li> Human-tiger conflict due to expanding settlements</li><br>
            <li>Poaching for traditional medicine</li>
            </ol> <br>
            By understanding tigers and their importance, we can better design effective conservation strategies, implement practical protection measures, educate communities about peaceful coexistence and preserve crucial ecosystems for future generations</p>
